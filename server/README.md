## Data flow
The flow is pretty standard, directly from upper layer to down and via notification from down to up. I just tried to use another approach in the infrastructure layer to show another way by using an observer pattern.


## How to build & run the app:

- By running this command you can run the application:

```
dotnet watch run
```
